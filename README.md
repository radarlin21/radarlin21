- 👋 Hi, I’m @radarlin21
- 👀 I’m interested in using spatial data to advance conservation goals, working with nonprofits, governments, and the public.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the ins and outs of using R and ArcPro with spatial data packages, working mostly with ebird data.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on spatial data analysis for bird population, distribution and occurrence data, in conjunction with environmental variables. 
- 📫 How to reach me: email radarlin@umich.edu.
