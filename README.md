- 👋 Hi, I’m @radarlin21
- 👀 I’m interested in using spatial data to advance conservation goals, working with nonprofits, governments, and the public.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to work with data from GPS-tagged American Woodcock in the Eastern Managment Region, as the newest PhD student with the Eastern Woodcock Migration Research Cooperative (https://www.woodcockmigration.org/).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on spatial data analysis for bird population, distribution and occurrence data, in conjunction with environmental variables. 
- 📫 How to reach me: email rachel.darling@maine.edu.
